	<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h3>How much should I be saving?</h3>
		<p>Don't feel like you need to be too ambitious, but do start thinking about the future. As a general
		rule, start with saving 10% of your income each month, then increase from there if possible. This will provide you with a
		 safety net in case of an emergency, as well as enough to retire at around 60-65 years old.</p>
		<h3>How much should I be spending on housing?</h3>
		<p>For many years, people were encouraged to never spend more than 30% of their income on housing. However, in today's
		market, things are very different. Try to spend only around 50% of your income on necessities. As food prices continue
		to drop and housing prices continue to rise, your own personal ratio may look a little different.</p>
	 	<h3>When should I start saving for retirement?</h3>
		<p>The simple answer is as early as possible! Even if it doesn't feel like very much at the time, find an amount
		that you can stick to, because compound interest is your friend. Ask your employer if they will match your savings
		or if they have a pension plan. Always make sure that you are planning for the future even if it seems far away
		or you can't afford to save right now.</p>
